User-Registeration-and-Authentication-Flask-SQLAlchemy-Python

The code in this section includes a simple Flask app which is an API that represents items. It also includes user registration and authentication. It is also extended by adding persistent storage of Items with SQLAlchemy—an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)—which allows us to easily replace SQLite with something like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
